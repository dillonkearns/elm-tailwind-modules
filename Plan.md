# Plan

* [ ] Simplify call structure in code-generation (get rid of options)
* [ ] Extract elm code generation elements
* [ ] Use 'property' instead of typed elm-css
* [ ] Switch to elm-origami (or?)
* [ ] Figure out how to handle custom css:
  - Either: Find component css selectors (group by .prose, e.g.)
  - Or: Run differently for `@tailwind utilities` and `@tailwind components`
