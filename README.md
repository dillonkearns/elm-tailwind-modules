# Elm Tailwind Origami

ðŸš§ **This is still WIP** ðŸš§

This is a fork of [postcss-elm-css-tailwind](https://github.com/justinrassier/postcss-elm-css-tailwind) with the goal of working with [elm-origami](https://github.com/justinrassier/postcss-elm-css-tailwind) instead of elm-css. Replacing elm-css with elm-origami hasn't happened yet.

Unlike postcss-elm-css-tailwind this is missing breakpoint code generation as of yet. On the plus side it handles a lot more tailwind, e.g. the typography plugin works.

If you have any thoughts, please create an issue.

There is no CLI, yet. So if you want to check out how to run this, take a look at `test/test-run.js`.
